# Newton's-method
This code implements Newton's method in Python.
You can approximately find x where f(x) = 0.
*** Note that the function f(x) of the value to be calculated must be a convex function, and its error handling is not implemented.
*** This code is just a practice code.
*** The Newton method of this code only supports one dimension, not multiple dimensions.

## Download & Setup
Download the source code, by running in the terminal:
```
git clone https://github.com/yasu-kun/Newton-s-method
```

## Preparation
This code uses sympy.
Install it with the following command if necessary.


```pip install sympy```
or
```conda install simply```


## Using Newton's-method
The `Newton's-method`-constructor takes the following parameters:

* `function`: The function you want to find f(x) = 0
